    fix: array init and ref, program chunks

can't understand why 
code: binops  : "-" binops  
is redundant because fexp is not nullable/epsillon

bison produced rule
code: 7 rvalue: "var" ID ":"
WTH !?

    fix: fexp to lvalue (texp); vardec and exp collision needs to be resolved

Note:
code: 6 vardec: "var" ID ":="
code: 7 rvalue: "var" ID ":"
i guess this is happening because exps are not bounded by ";" so the parses is thinking vardec is simply
code: 6 vardec: "var" ID ":="
and then a new/separate exp is starting as an rvalue
Though good news is my conflict for shift/reduce is singular :D

added 
code: chunks  : chunk ";" chunks      /* adding semicolon to bound exp from decl, desperate move */
code:        | /* nullable epsillon */
code:        ;
still not helping (parser is totally removing the binops production !?)

OMGGGG it WAS A TYPOOOOO ":" instead of "|" 
thank god i installed a syntax highlighter for yacc :/
